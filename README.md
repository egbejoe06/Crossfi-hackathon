# DeScholar: Empowering Researchers and Educators with Blockchain

## What It Does

### 1. Decentralized Research Publishing
Researchers can publish their work as NFTs, ensuring they have full control over their intellectual property. Research is stored securely on IPFS via Pinata for immutable, decentralized access.

### 2. Tokenized Incentives with ICO
The ICO Smart Contract facilitates the distribution of tokens, which are rewarded to users participating in the platform. These tokens are used to incentivize contributions, such as funding proposals and peer reviews.

### 3. Decentralized Research Proposals
Researchers can create and manage research proposals, receiving funding contributions directly through smart contracts.

### 4. Community Collaboration
The Research Group Smart Contract enables users to form, manage, and interact in research groups with reputation-based roles, fostering a collaborative academic environment.

### 5. Academic Q&A Platform
The Question and Answer Smart Contract facilitates discussions, where users can ask questions, submit answers, and contribute to academic discourse.
